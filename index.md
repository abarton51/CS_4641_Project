This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] – the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.

## Introduction/Background: 
A quick introduction of your topic and mostly literature review of what has been done in this area. You can briefly explain your dataset and its features here too.

**Problem definition:** Why there is a problem here or what is the motivation of the project?

**Methods:** What algorithms or methods are you going to use to solve the problems. (Note: Methods may change when you start implementing them which is fine). Students are encouraged to use existing packages and libraries (i.e. scikit-learn) instead of coding the algorithms from scratch.

**Potential results and Discussion** (The results may change while you are working on the project and it is fine; that’s why it is called research). A good way to talk about potential results is to discuss about what type of quantitative metrics your team plan to use for the project (i.e. ML Metrics).

At least **three references** (preferably peer reviewed). You need to properly cite the references on your proposal. This part does NOT count towards word limit.

Add proposed **timeline** from start to finish and list each project members’ responsibilities. Fall and Spring semester sample Gantt Chart. This part does NOT count towards word limit.

A **contribution table** with all group members’ names that explicitly provides the contribution of each member in preparing the project task. This part does NOT count towards word limit.

A **checkpoint** to make sure you are working on a proper machine learning related project. You are required to have your dataset ready when you submit your proposal. You can change dataset later. However, you are required to provide some reasonings why you need to change the dataset (i.e. dataset is not large enough because it does not provide us a good accuracy comparing to other dataset; we provided accuracy comparison between these two datasets). The reasonings can be added as a section to your future project reports such as midterm report.

Your group needs to **submit a presentation of your proposal**. Please provide us a public link which includes a **3 minutes recorded video**. I found that OBS Studio and GT subscribed Kaltura are good tools to record your screen. Please make your visuals are clearly visible in your **video presentation**.

**3 MINUTE** is a hard stop. We will NOT accept submissions which are 3 minutes and one second or above. Conveying the message easily while being concise is not easy and it is a great soft skill for any stage of your life, especially your work life.
