## Introduction
A quick introduction of your topic and mostly literature review of what has been done in this area. Briefly explain your dataset and its features and provide a link to your dataset if applicable.

### Datasets
**MusicNet**: Description and link to dataset.
MusicNet is a collection of 330 freely-licensed classical music recordings, together with over 1 million annotated labels indicating the precise time of each note in every recording, the instrument that plays each note, and the note's position in the metrical structure of the composition. The labels are acquired from musical scores aligned to recordings by dynamic time warping. The labels are verified by trained musicians; a labeling error rate of 4% has been estimated. The MusicNet labels are offered to the machine learning and music communities as a resource for training models and a common benchmark for comparing results.

## Results and Discussion

### MusicNet
- Quantitative metrics
- F1 Scores, confusion matrix, etc.

### GTZAN
- Quantitative metrics
- F1 Scores, confusion matrix, etc.

### Discussion
**MusicNet**: Data is not distributed well. Need to go actually get more data if we want to reliably do classificaiton on all the composers in the dataset.

**GTZAN**:

**Overall**:
