## Introduction
A quick introduction of your topic and mostly literature review of what has been done in this area. Briefly explain your dataset and its features and provide a link to your dataset if applicable.

### Datasets
**MusicNet**: Description and link to dataset.

**GTZAN**: Description and link to dataset.

## Problem Definition
Why there is a problem here? What is the motivation of the project? 

## Methods

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**MusicNet**:

**GTZAN**:

### Data Preprocessing
**MusicNet**:

**GTZAN**:

#### Dimensionality Reduction - PCA
**MusicNet**:
- Brief description and include visuals if applicable.

**Chosen Model(s)**
- Description of Implementation, hyperparameter selection, computation time, etc.

## Results and Discusssion

### MusicNet
- Quantitative metrics
- F1 Scores, confusion matrix, etc.

### GTZAN
- Quantitative metrics
- F1 Scores, confusion matrix, etc.

### Discussion
**MusicNet**: Data is not distributed well. Need to go actually get more data if we want to reliably do classificaiton on all the composers in the dataset.

**GTZAN**:

**Overall**:

#### Next Steps
