# MIDI Files and Composer Identification

## What are MIDI Files?

MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. MIDI files are a type of digital file format used to represent music in a way that computers and electronic musical instruments can understand. Unlike audio files (e.g., MP3 or WAV), MIDI files do not contain actual audio recordings. Instead, they contain a set of instructions that describe how music should be played. These instructions include information about note pitch, duration, velocity (how forcefully a note is played), tempo, and other musical parameters.

MIDI files are versatile and lightweight, making them ideal for tasks like composer identification, as they focus on the musical structure and elements rather than the audio itself.

## Composer Identification

Composer identification is a subfield of music information retrieval (MIR) that aims to determine the composer of a piece of music based on its musical characteristics. Here are some relevant works and approaches in composer identification:

1. **Feature Extraction:** Researchers often start by extracting various musical features from MIDI files. These features can include pitch histograms, rhythm patterns, harmony information, and more. Extracting meaningful features is crucial as they serve as input to machine learning models.

2. **Machine Learning Models:** Machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and deep learning neural networks have been applied to classify compositions by different composers. These models learn patterns from the extracted features to make predictions.

3. **Statistical Analysis:** Some methods involve statistical analysis of MIDI data, looking at specific compositional styles, chord progressions, or note distributions associated with particular composers.

4. **Genre-Based Approaches:** In addition to composer identification, some studies focus on identifying the genre of a musical piece, which can aid in narrowing down the list of potential composers.

5. **Symbolic Music Representation:** MIDI files provide a symbolic representation of music, allowing researchers to analyze the composition's structure, harmony, and melody. This can provide valuable insights for composer identification.

6. **Large Datasets:** Building a robust composer identification model often requires a large and diverse dataset of MIDI files from various composers and musical eras.

7. **Evaluation Metrics:** Researchers use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of their composer identification models.

It's important to note that composer identification can be a challenging task, as some composers may have diverse styles, and there can be similarities between the works of different composers. However, with the advancements in machine learning and music analysis techniques, it is possible to develop accurate models for this task.

As you work on your project with the MIDI dataset you mentioned, consider exploring the above approaches and techniques to build a successful composer identification model. Additionally, ensure that you have a suitable evaluation methodology to assess the performance of your model accurately.
